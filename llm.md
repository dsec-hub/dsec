# DSEC workspace — MCP guide for AI assistants

_For: full read + write + AI access (reference copy)._
_Generated for a key with scope(s): `read`, `write`, `trigger`. This file contains no secret —
the key is shown only as `dsec_live_YOUR_KEY` — so it's safe to commit or paste into a chat._

You are connected (or about to connect) to the **DSEC committee workspace** over
**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. Through it you can read and update the club's members,
finances, events, community projects, task boards, meetings, documents, sponsors
and partner orgs — the same data the human sees in the dashboard. Everything you
change writes to the club's single source of truth and shows up in the dashboard
(and, for published events/projects, on the public website).

## What this key can do

- `read` — **yes**. View workspace data — members, finances, events, projects, tasks, meetings, documents, sponsors, partners and people.
- `write` — **yes**. Create and update workspace data — events (plus speaker, sponsor and partner line-ups), projects, task boards, meetings, documents, sponsors (pipeline, packages, leads, contacts), partners and people.
- `trigger` — **yes**. Run AI features that spend tokens — currently generating meeting notes and action items from a transcript.
- `ingest` — no. Import the weekly DUSA membership / P&L spreadsheets. Admin-only and used by the ingestion pipeline over REST — there are no MCP tools for it.

Scopes are **coarse and global**: a `write` key can write *every* module (not just one), and a `read` key can read everything. They are bounded by the dashboard role of whoever minted the key, not by module.

## Connect (the human does this once)

- **Server URL:** `https://api.dsec.club/mcp`
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP
- **Auth:** send the key as a header — `Authorization: Bearer dsec_live_YOUR_KEY`

Replace `dsec_live_YOUR_KEY` with the real `dsec_live_…` key (shown only once when it
was minted at **Settings → API & MCP** in the dashboard).

**Claude Code (CLI)**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http dsec https://api.dsec.club/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer dsec_live_YOUR_KEY"
```

**Claude Desktop** — `claude_desktop_config.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dsec": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.dsec.club/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer dsec_live_YOUR_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai / ChatGPT / Codex (custom connector)** — add a custom MCP connector,
set the URL to `https://api.dsec.club/mcp`, and add the header
`Authorization: Bearer dsec_live_YOUR_KEY`.

## House rules (follow these)

- **Call `whoami` first** to confirm which scopes this key holds before planning any work.
- **Never invent IDs.** Use the matching `list_*` tool to find the id you need; resolve people (assignees, leads, speakers) with `list_people`.
- **Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.**
- **Events and projects are private drafts** until you set `is_public=true` — they only reach the public website once published.
- **Updates are partial:** pass only the fields you want to change; anything you omit is left untouched.
- **Uploads aren't here.** Images and files are added in the dashboard; the `list_media` / `list_attachments` tools are read-only.
- **Confirm irreversible actions with the human first** — `archive_event`, `delete_sponsor_package`, `remove_*` and `unlink_*` change shared club data.
- **AI tools spend real tokens** and are cost-capped server-side — use `generate_meeting_notes` deliberately, not speculatively.
- Writes and AI calls are **rate-limited**; if a call is throttled, back off and tell the human rather than hammering it.

## Recipes

- **Status check:** “How many current members do we have, what's our closing balance this term, and what events are coming up?” → `member_stats`, `finance_summary`, `list_events`.
- **Run a new event end-to-end:** `create_event` (leave it a draft) → `set_event_budget` → `add_event_speaker` → `link_event_sponsor`; publish later with `update_event(is_public=true)`.
- **Plan work:** `create_board` → `create_task` (resolve the assignee with `list_people` first) → `move_task` as it progresses.
- **Minutes from a transcript:** `create_meeting` → paste the transcript into `generate_meeting_notes` → it writes notes and action items back to the meeting.

## When a tool is refused

If a call fails with a message like `scope 'write' required`, this key simply lacks that scope — it's not a bug. Tell the human to mint a key with the scope they need at **Settings → API & MCP** (the scopes anyone can grant are capped by their dashboard role, so they may need a broader role first).
